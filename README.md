# Duel-RTOS-Game
A game where there are two tanks on each side of the LCD screen and the goal is to shoot the other until their health is depleted. This is a two-player game where the boards communicate using a UART protocol. We use a gyroscope to move the tanks on the screen. We get information from the gyroscope using the Spi protocol. We have a light sensor that puts the game into dark mode at a  certain light level. This information is passed to us using the I2C protocol between the board's peripherals. We use the IO-expander led's to keep track of health and also use the EEPROM to remember the win streak. There are many i/o buttons to shoot and start the game. Watch the video for a better in-depth explanation of the game.
